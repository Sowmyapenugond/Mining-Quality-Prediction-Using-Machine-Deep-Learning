The "Mining Quality Prediction Using Machine & Deep Learning" project leverages advanced data-driven techniques to predict the quality of mined resources with higher precision. 
It involves the application of algorithms like Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, and deep neural networks to analyze complex patterns in mining data, such as mineral compositions, geological properties, and machinery performance. 
By using these predictive models, mining companies can anticipate the quality of extracted materials, enabling them to fine-tune operations for improved yield, minimize operational risks, and enhance sustainability. 
The use of both traditional machine learning and deep learning ensures robust performance across diverse datasets.
